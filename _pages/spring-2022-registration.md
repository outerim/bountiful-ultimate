Spring league is starting up real soon and it's time to start getting registered. Please [contact me](mailto:chimera.ulti@gmail.com) if you have any questions.

> A few things I want to mention before I dive into details. Our practices will **always** be open, meaning you’re welcome to continue attending even if you’re not participating in events this season. Keep on coming out, learning, and having fun. As a kid I couldn’t participate in team sports for financial reasons. I don’t want that to be a barrier for anyone who wants to play for our team. We can help cover league fees for players on an as needed basis. Reach out if you have concerns.

League games will be held at various locations across the Wasatch front on Wednesday evenings. There will also be an end of season tournament.

## Teams
Based on practice attendance so far this season we don't have enough younger players for a separate Middle School team. Right now we're planning on having 1 team competing in the High School D2 division. This should be a good match for the skills of our players overall. This is the same division we competed in during the fall tournament last year. Younger players are welcome to participate.

## Team dues/Jerseys
Team dues for the season will be $25/player. We'll be ordering or official Jersey set this season. Cost for a full set (light and dark) will be $50.
Instructions on [how to pay](/pay). If paying for Jerseys along with team dues include in the payment note: Size, Name you want printed on the back (usually last name), and Desired number (99 or less). Lead time for Jerseys is **5-6 weeks**. I'd like to have Jersey orders in by early next week if possible so please pay quickly.

Total for Jerseys and dues will be $75/player.
