Fall league is starting up real soon and it's time to start getting registered. Please [contact me](mailto:chimera.ulti@gmail.com) if you have any questions.

> A few things I want to mention before I dive into details. Our practices will **always** be open, meaning you’re welcome to continue attending even if you’re not participating in events this season. Keep on coming out, learning, and having fun. As a kid I couldn’t participate in team sports for financial reasons. I don’t want that to be a barrier for anyone who wants to play for our team. We can help cover league fees for players on an as needed basis. Reach out if you have concerns.

## Important Dates
* League games will be held at various locations across the Wasatch front on Wednesday evenings beginning **Sept 14th**.
* End of season tournament on **Nov 4th and 5th**
* Provo 3v3 tournament on Labor Day (**Sept 5th**)

## Team dues/Jerseys
* Team dues for the fall are $25. 
* Jerseys are $60 for a full set of white/dark.
* Instructions on [how to pay](/pay).
> If paying for Jerseys along with team dues include in the payment note: Size, Name you want printed on the back (usually last name), and Desired number (99 or less). Lead time for Jerseys is **5-6 weeks**. I'd like to have Jersey orders in by **Sept 5th** so please act quickly.
