## Scholarships available
Growing up I desperately wanted to play sports but it was simply unaffordable for my family. I don't want money to be the reason that any kid has to sit on the sidelines like I did. Please <a href="mailto:chimera.ulti@gmail.com">reach out to Coach Lee</a> if cost represents a burden that would keep you from participating. I'll do everything I can to accommodate your situation.
