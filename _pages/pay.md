## Scholarships available
Growing up I desperately wanted to play sports but it was simply unaffordable for my family. I don't want money to be the reason that any kid has to sit on the sidelines like I did. Please <a href="mailto:chimera.ulti@gmail.com">reach out to Coach Lee</a> if this cost represents a burden that would keep your child from participating. I'll do everything I can to accommodate your situation.

## Paying fees

### PayPal
The team has it's own PayPal account which doubles as our checking account. This is the preferred way to send funds.

1. Click <a href="https://paypal.me/ChimeraUltimate/130" target="_blank">Pay with PayPal</a>
2. Sign in
3. <strong>Un</strong>-check the box labeled 'paying for goods or services' (otherwise the team is charged a 3% fee)
4. Enter a note with your player's name.
5. Select your payment method (use a bank account, PayPal balance, or debit card to avoid fees) and confirm the payment.

### Venmo
Slightly less preferred but fine if you don't have a PayPal account.

1. My Venmo username is @outerim
2. [This link](https://www.venmo.com/outerim) should get you to the right place
3. Enter the amount and the name of the player or players you're paying for and send.
