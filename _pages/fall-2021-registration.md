Fall league is starting up real soon and there are a few steps I need you to take asap to get ready. Please [contact me](mailto:chimera.ulti@gmail.com) if you have any questions.

> A few things I want to mention before I dive into details. Our practices will **always** be open, meaning you’re welcome to continue attending even if you’re not participating in events this season. Keep on coming out, learning, and having fun. As a kid I couldn’t participate in team sports for financial reasons. I don’t want that to be a barrier for anyone who wants to play for our team. 

Fall league games will be held at various locations across the Wasatch front on Wednesday evenings beginning Sept 15 through Oct 20. There will also be an end of season tournament on Nov 5th and 6th (location TBD).

## Teams

We're planning to have 2 teams, one each in the U15 and U19 divisions. You're eligible to play U15 this year if you don't turn 15 until sometime after Dec 31 2021. Having two teams means **we could really use an assistant coach or chaperone to help on game days**. If you plan on attending games and would be able/willing to help out please let me know.

Here are my roster suggestions. I don't know everyone's birthdates so let me know if I've made a mistake. If you're missing and don't know which division you should participate in I can give you some guidance. If you have any concerns about the division I'm asking you to play in, speak up! We may need to shuffle things around even early on in the season.

| U19      | U15 |
| --- | ---|
| Aiden | Addie |
| Emilee | Joseph |
| Jack | Josh |
| Jamison | Kaleb |
| Jayden | Lincoln |
| Jayson | Mac |
| Kade | Miles |
| Kinley | Samantha |
| Owen |
| Peyton |
| Xander |

Our U15 squad could obviously use some more players Keep up your recruiting efforts and if you'd be willing to switch teams let me know.

## Team dues/Jerseys
Team dues for the season will be $25/player. For the fall we're going to go with a simple, non-mesh, reversible tank with our team logo. This will be included in the cost of dues. Players who have our official Jerseys can continue to use them for games. Tanks will be great for practice and should be brought there to help us divide teams more easily during scrimmages. Instructions on [how to pay](/pay). Include in your venmo/paypal note your desired tank top size (ie youth small, etc).
