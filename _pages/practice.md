## Practice schedule
Practices are open to all 5th-12th grade boys and girls. If you're curious about the sport you're welcome to come try it out!

Practices days, times, and locations vary depending on the season. For summer 2023 we will be at [Oak Hills Elementary](https://goo.gl/maps/e9dEQGmLe5MZM5Yw9) in Bountiful.
* Wednesday 4-5:30pm

## What to bring

Wear clothing that you can comfortably move and run in. Jeans for example are not ideal. In addition:

* One white and one dark colored shirt (so we can divide teams for scrimmages)
* Plenty of water. Even if the weather is cool your body needs water
* Cleats (running shoes are ok in a pinch but if you plan to participate a set of soccer cleats will really help)
* A learning mindset

## Practice Etiquette

Come to practice ready to learn. When the coach is talking, gather around, make sure you can hear, and don't be carrying on side conversations with your friends. Even if you think you understand what's being taught there's always more to learn. Be respectful and attentive and always trying to figure out how you can improve.
