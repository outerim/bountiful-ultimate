Chimera currently practices once a week. Fridays from 2:30-4:30 at [Lewis Park](https://goo.gl/maps/ZRvMYVk1CETT7AKm8) in Bountiful. Practices will likely end in late October or early November. We'll go until the weather turns too cold or field conditions prevent us. There may even be some opportunities to scrimmage against other local teams or attend the fall state tournament.

## What to bring

Good athletic shoes are a must. Cleats are optional but highly recommended. Wear clothing that you can comfortably move and run in. Jeans for example are not ideal. In addition:

* One white and one dark colored shirt (so we can divide teams for scrimmages.)
* Plenty of water. Even if the weather is cool your body needs water.
* A learning mindset.

## Practice Etiquette

Come to practice ready to learn. When the coach is talking, gather around, make sure you can hear, and don't be carrying on side conversations with your friends. Even if you think you understand what's being taught there's always more to learn. Nothing is more frustrating as a coach than having to constantly be asking for quiet so he or she can speak.
