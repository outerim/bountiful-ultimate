## Practice schedule
Practices are open to all 5th-12th graders. We practice at [Lewis Park](https://goo.gl/maps/yHBn8AxMc3rVmngMA) in Bountiful.
* Monday 4-5:30pm
* Wednesday 4-5:30pm
* Friday 1-3pm

**Note: Practices will extend to 6pm in late February/early March as the days get longer*

## What to bring

Wear clothing that you can comfortably move and run in. Jeans for example are not ideal. In addition:

* One white and one dark colored shirt (so we can divide teams for scrimmages)
* Plenty of water. Even if the weather is cool your body needs water
* Cleats (running shoes are ok in a pinch but if you plan to participate a set of soccer cleats will really help)
* A learning mindset

## Practice Etiquette

Come to practice ready to learn. When the coach is talking, gather around, make sure you can hear, and don't be carrying on side conversations with your friends. Even if you think you understand what's being taught there's always more to learn. Nothing is more frustrating as a coach than having to constantly be asking for quiet so he or she can speak.
