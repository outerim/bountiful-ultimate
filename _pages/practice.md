Chimera currently practices 3 times a week. Tuesdays & Thursdays from 4-6pm at the field behind [Oak Hills Elementary](https://www.google.com/maps/place/300+S+@+1226+E/@40.8855255,-111.8550633,18z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x8752580875fc69e7:0xab5101ed3e78fb9!8m2!3d40.885676!4d-111.8550149?authuser=1) in Bountiful. On days when we have games, beginning in late March our Thursday practice will be replaced with a game. The season will run through end of May.

## What to bring

Wear clothing that you can comfortably move and run in. Jeans for example are not ideal. In addition:

* One white and one dark colored shirt (so we can divide teams for scrimmages)
* Plenty of water. Even if the weather is cool your body needs water
* Cleats (running shoes are ok in a pinch but if you plan to participate a set of soccer cleats will really help)
* A learning mindset

## Practice Etiquette

Come to practice ready to learn. When the coach is talking, gather around, make sure you can hear, and don't be carrying on side conversations with your friends. Even if you think you understand what's being taught there's always more to learn. Nothing is more frustrating as a coach than having to constantly be asking for quiet so he or she can speak.
