We need both player participants and adult volunteers to make this team successful. 

## Players

The most important thing you can do for the team is to [attend practice](/practice) regularly. Take time outside of practice to work on your throws and improve your fitness.

The next most important thing you can do is **recruit your friends**. Share this website on social media, pass out [flyers](/files/flyer.pdf) at school, invite people to come to practice with you, etc.

Finally, learn as much as you can about the sport. Read the rules, watch games online, and check out these additional resources to help you learn the game.

* [10 Simple rules of Ultimate](https://www.usaultimate.org/resources/officiating/rules/default.aspx#10simplerules) is a great place to start.
* I also put together a couple YouTube playlists to help new players learn [throwing techniques]() and [offensive/defensive strategies]() we'll be using.


## Parents

Ultimate isn't like other sports. We expect exemplary sportsmanship from our players and higher standards are also expected of those watching from the sidelines. UUDA has put together a [helpful list of do's and don'ts](/files/spectator-dos-donts.pdf) for spectators. To make the most of your sideline experience check out USAU's [spectator guide](https://www.usaultimate.org/assets/1/Page/Spectator%20Guide%202016_web.pdf) to help you quickly get up to speed and better understand what's happening on the field.

We'd also love for you to get even more involved in the team. Keep reading for other ways you can help out!

## Adult Volunteers

Many hands make light work and team sports are no exception. No matter your background or skills there are definitely ways to help the team. Some examples include:

* Coordinating carpools or just being a volunteer driver
* Managing team finances
* Assistant coaching (no experience required)
* Graphic Design
* Marketing/promotion
* Logistics (spreadsheets, equipment orders, player registrations, etc)
