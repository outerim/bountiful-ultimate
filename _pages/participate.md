We need both player participants and adult volunteers to make this team successful. 

## Players

The most important thing you can do for the team is to attend practice regularly. Practices are held each Friday this fall at [Lewis Park](https://goo.gl/maps/ZRvMYVk1CETT7AKm8) from 2:30-4:30pm. Practices will likely end in late October or early November. We'll go until the weather turns too cold or field conditions prevent us. There may even be some opportunities to scrimmage against other local teams or attend the fall state tournament.

The next most important thing you can do is **recruit your friends**. Share this website on social media, pass out [flyers]() at school, invite people to come to practice with you, etc.

## Adult Volunteers

Many hands make light work and team sports are no exception. No matter your background or skills there are definitely ways to help the team. Some examples include:

* Coordinating carpools or just being a volunteer driver
* Managing team finances
* Assistant coaching (no experience required)
* Graphic Design
* Marketing/promotion
* Logistics (spreadsheets, equipment orders, etc)
