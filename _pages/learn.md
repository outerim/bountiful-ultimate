Bountiful Ultimate is a brand new Ultimate team. The goal is to develop middle school players who can eventually form the foundation of a team centered at Bountiful High School by Fall 2022. These teams will compete in [UUDA](https://utahultimate.org) sponsored leagues as well as tournaments at the local, state, and possibly even higher levels. The middle school division is all about developing players. Helping them learn the sport and getting them excited about participating in High School, College, and beyond. Many players who start young play ultimate for decades and it becomes the basis of a long term healthy lifestyle.

# What is Ultimate?

Ultimate is an exciting, fast paced, non-contact, field sport played with a Frisbee&trade;. (We generally just call it a disc because Frisbee&trade; is a trademarked term for a single brand of disc.) Two teams of 7 players take the field and essentially play keep away from each other, passing the disc between players and attempting to score in the end zone the other team is defending. A turnover occurs when one team drops the disc, catches it out of bounds, or delays more than 10 seconds between throws. The opposing team immediately takes possesion and tries to score in the opposing end zone. Play continues until one team scores by catching the disc in their opponent's end zone at which point substitutions may occur and the team which just scored 'pulls' the disc to their opponents (similar to a kickoff in Football.)

# Spirit of the Game

One of the defining characteristics of Ultimate is it's emphasis on a principle called Spirit of the Game which is defined in this way:

> Ultimate relies on a spirit of sportsmanship that places the responsibility for fair play on the player. Highly competitive play is encouraged, but never at the expense of mutual respect among players, adherence to the agreed upon rules, or the basic joy of play. Such actions as taunting, aggression, intentional infractions or other win-at-all-costs behavior are contrary to Spirit of the Game and must be avoided.

This is why I love ultimate. Even at the highest levels of play Ultimate is self-refereed. Players are expected to make calls, discuss them, and attempt to resolve on field disputes without devolving into shouting matches between coaches. In fact, coaches and bystanders (whether players or fans) must not attempt to influence these on-field discussions. The rules are designed to help resolve inevitable disagreements in a fair manner. If you watch professional sports the general attitude is "get away with whatever you can when the ref's back is turned". That's not sportsmanship, it's gamesmanship. Ultimate teaches kids what true sportsmanship is.

# Coaches

**Head Coach Lee Jensen:** I've been playing Ultimate for the last 10 years or so. About the time my first daughter was born I realized I wanted to get in better shape but I found it boring to go to a gym alone or jog mindlessly on a treadmill. I'd played some Ultimate with friends as a kid and wondered if I could find a group of people to play with near me. A quick google search led me to a local pickup group who played on their lunch hours not far from my home where I was working at the time. I joined them, started learning the sport, and eventually joined Salt Lake County leagues and other club teams.

2 years ago I found out about a Middle School league and decided to sign my kids up for it but there wasn't a team near us. We started commuting to Salt Lake several times a week to play with the West Krakens Middle School team. They were in desperate need of some coaching help and being the only parent who knew much about the sport I volunteered. Now that that team is in a more self sustaining place I'd like to build something a little closer to home.

I've got a serious passion for Ultimate. I see it as a vehicle to promote a healthy active lifestyle, teach kids discipline and sportsmanship, and do it all in a supportive/positive environment. I'm excited to build the sport here in our home town!

If you're interested in learning more, here are some resources:

* This [Spectators Guide](https://www.usaultimate.org/assets/1/Page/Spectator%20Guide%202016_web.pdf) put out by USAU gives a great intro to the game and how to make sense of what you're seeing on the field.
* New players will benefit from reviewing a [simplified Ultimate ruleset](https://www.usaultimate.org/resources/officiating/rules/default.aspx#10simplerules).
* I also put together a couple YouTube playlists to help new players learn [throwing techniques]() and [offensive/defensive strategies]() we'll be using.
