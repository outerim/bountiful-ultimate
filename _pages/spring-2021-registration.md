Spring league is starting up real soon and there are a few steps I need you to take asap to get ready. Please [contact me](mailto:chimera.ulti@gmail.com) if you have any questions.

> A few things I want to mention before I dive into details. Our practices will **always** be open, meaning you’re welcome to continue attending even if you’re not participating in events this season. Keep on coming out, learning, and having fun. As a kid I couldn’t participate in team sports for financial reasons. I don’t want that to be a barrier for anyone who wants to play for our team. Please review the info below, *pretending cost is no object*, fill out the registration form, and let me know what, if any, accommodations you might need on the last step.

## This season's events

With that out of the way, the first order of business is to decide which events you’d like to participate in this season. Here’s the list. Level of interest from players will determine which of these events we’re able to participate in as a team. For tournaments, plan on 9am start each day, ending between 2 and 5pm depending on the number of teams participating.

1. Middle School State Tournament. May 14-15 @ the Salt Lake Regional Athletic Complex. $20/player (free for those participating in Spring League)
2. Mountain Showdown MS Tournament. Apr 16-17 @ the Salt Lake Equestrian Center. $15/player (Location may change or event delayed due to COVID policies of the center unless restrictions loosen before April)

## How to register

**If you intend to participate in any of these events you’ll need to register with USA Ultimate.** Head on over to [the USAU website](https://play.usaultimate.org/members/login). If you haven’t played before you’ll need to create an account for your player(s) by clicking “Join USA Ultimate”. If you’re already a USAU member log in to your player account. Once logged in or registered there are a couple steps to take for each player.

*Here's a quick screenshot to show you where to find things on the USAU site*
