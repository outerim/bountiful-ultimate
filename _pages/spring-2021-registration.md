Spring league is starting up real soon and there are a few steps I need you to take asap to get ready. Please [contact me](mailto:chimera.ulti@gmail.com) if you have any questions.

> A few things I want to mention before I dive into details. Our practices will **always** be open, meaning you’re welcome to continue attending even if you’re not participating in events this season. Keep on coming out, learning, and having fun. As a kid I couldn’t participate in team sports for financial reasons. I don’t want that to be a barrier for anyone who wants to play for our team. Please review the info below, *pretending cost is no object*, fill out the registration form, and let me know what, if any, accommodations you might need on the last step.

With that out of the way, the first order of business is to decide which events you’d like to participate in this season. Here’s the list. Level of interest from players will determine which of these events we’re able to participate in as a team. For tournaments, plan on 9am start each day, ending between 2 and 5pm depending on the number of teams participating.

1. Spring League. Cost $50/player, includes State tournament in May. Games held Mar 17-May 5 on Wednesday evenings at 4 and/or 5:30. Some weeks will be double headers. Games will be scheduled at field sites from Lehi to Bountiful depending on the teams we’re playing. We should have half our games at home. Carpools can be arranged as needed.
2. Middle School State Tournament. May 14-15 @ the Salt Lake Regional Athletic Complex. $20/player (free for those participating in Spring League)
3. YouThaw 3v3 Tournament. Mar 20 @ Kaysville Jr High. Suggested $10 donation per player
4. Mountain Showdown MS Tournament. Apr 16-17 @ the Salt Lake Equestrian Center. $15/player (Location may change or event delayed due to COVID policies of the center unless restrictions loosen before April)
5. Girls 3v3 Tournaments. Apr 10 @ Legacy Events Center in Farmington, Jun 12 @ TBD. Additional events in the fall. I believe these are free events but information is still forthcoming.

**If you intend to participate in any of these events you’ll need to register with USA Ultimate.** Head on over to [the USAU website](https://play.usaultimate.org/members/login). If you haven’t played before you’ll need to create an account for your player(s) by clicking “Join USA Ultimate”. If you’re already a USAU member log in to your player account. Once logged in or registered there are a couple steps to take for each player.

1. Make a note of your USAU ID number - you’ll need that during step 5
2. Complete the Liability Waiver
3. Complete the Infectious Disease (COVID) Waiver
4. Purchase a player membership. The cost is only $17 per player and provides insurance coverage and various other benefits we get from the national organization. Select purchase membership (seen in the upper left of the screenshot below). On the next page select **Affiliate Player** for the membership level, and Utah for Participating state.
