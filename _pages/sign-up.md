Chimera is a non-profit Ultimate club. The team is open to **all 5th-8th grade boys and girls**. No cuts will be made. Our [practices](/practice) are open to anyone so if you're on the fence about joining come and see what you think.

<strong>Have a player older than 8th grade?</strong>UUDA runs a high school division for 9th grade and older but Chimera does not yet have a high school team. These students are welcome to practice with us and recruit friends. If we get enough players we could have a HS team in the future. If your student is interested in participating league games this season reach out to [chimera.ulti@gmail.com](mailto:chimera.ulti@gmail.com) for a referral to a local High School team.
